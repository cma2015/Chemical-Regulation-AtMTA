 ! Simulation setting
 nstlim = 200000, dt = 0.002, ! Simulation time = 400ps.
 imin = 0, ! No minimization. 
 nmropt = 1, ! NMR
 iwrap = 1, ! The coordinates written to the restart and trajectory files will be "wrapped" into a primary box.

 ! Restart control
 ntx = 5, irest = 1, ! (default) Do not restart the simulation; instead, run as a new simulation.

 ! Print frequency control
 ntpr = 500, ntwr = 500, ntwx = 500, 

 ! Ensemble control
 ntp = 0, ! No pressure scaling .
 tautp = 0.5, ! Generally, values for TAUTP should be in the range of 0.5-5.0 ps, with a smaller value providing tighter coupling to the heat bath and, thus, faster heating and a less natural trajectory. 
 ntb = 1, ! constant volume (default when igb and ntp are both O, which are their defaults) periodicity is applied and PME.
 ntf = 2, ! bond interactions involving H-atoms omitted (use with NTC=2).
 ntc = 2, ! bonds involving hydrogen are constrained. 
 cut = 12.0, ! This is used to specify the nonbonded cutoff, in Angstroms.

 ! The restrained control
 ntr = 1, restraintmask = ":1-205@C,CA,N", restraint_wt = 10.0, ibelly = 0, 
 
 ! Temperature control. 
 ntt = 3, gamma_ln = 2.0, temp0 = 300.0, tempi = 10.0,
