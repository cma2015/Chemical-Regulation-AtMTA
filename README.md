# Chemical-Regulation-AtMTA
## **Expression analysis and predicted chemical regulation of the m6A writer *MTA* in *Arabidopsis***



## Introduction

- *N*6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase MTA plays vital roles in regulating plant growth and development, abiotic and biotic stress responses. However, the embryonic lethality of the *MTA* gene *via* loss-of-function mutant limited in-depth understanding of the biological significance of *MTA*. In this study, based on a series of bioinformatics analysis focusing on the expression patterns of *MTA* gene under different experimental conditions, and the effect of natural occurred non-synonymous SNPs, we postulated that there may be natural chemicals regulating MTA-SAM (substrate for methylation) binding interaction to modulate RNA m6A modification level. Comprehensive virtual screening and experimental assay highlighted a representative natural regulator, CNP0251613 (ADPG), which is of great significance for further investigations on the dynamic regulation pathway of m6A and more functions of MTA protein in plants.
